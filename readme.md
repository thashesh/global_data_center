## 📊 Analyses Performed

### 1. Data Center Footprint Analysis
**What was analyzed**
- Total number of data centers per country
- Distribution between hyperscale and colocation facilities

**Insights Produced**
- Identifies global hubs vs emerging markets
- Highlights markets dominated by hyperscalers versus shared infrastructure
- Reveals concentration risk in heavily clustered regions

---

### 2. Power Capacity vs Infrastructure Demand
**What was analyzed**
- Total power capacity (MW) compared to data center count
- Hyperscaler presence vs available power

**Insights Produced**
- Shows that power capacity does not scale linearly with the number of data centers
- Identifies markets where power availability may constrain future growth
- Flags potential grid or regulatory bottlenecks

---

### 3. Market Growth Rate Evaluation
**What was analyzed**
- Annual growth rate of data centers by country
- Growth trends compared against existing footprint

**Insights Produced**
- Distinguishes high-growth emerging markets from mature markets
- Identifies regions with strong expansion momentum
- Highlights where future infrastructure demand is likely to rise

---

### 4. Growth vs Saturation Classification
**What was analyzed**
- Growth rate plotted against total data center footprint
- Power capacity used as a weighting factor

**Insights Produced**
- **High growth + low footprint** → strong expansion opportunity  
- **High footprint + low growth** → market saturation risk  
- Helps prioritize markets with higher return potential

---

### 5. Hyperscaler Density Analysis
**What was analyzed**
- Number of hyperscalers relative to market size
- Power capacity per hyperscaler

**Insights Produced**
- Reveals competition intensity within markets
- Highlights potential under-provisioning of power
- Identifies oversubscription risks

---

### 6. Infrastructure Tier Distribution
**What was analyzed**
- Distribution of Tier I–IV data centers
- Market maturity based on reliability tiers

**Insights Produced**
- Identifies enterprise-grade vs developing markets
- Highlights regions suitable for mission-critical workloads
- Supports risk and resilience assessment

---

### 7. Sustainability & Renewable Adoption
**What was analyzed**
- Average renewable energy usage by market
- Power consumption vs sustainability indicators

**Insights Produced**
- Identifies regions aligned with ESG goals
- Highlights trade-offs between growth and sustainability
- Supports green infrastructure planning

---

## 🧠 Key Business Takeaways

- Mid-sized markets often present **better ROI** than saturated global hubs
- Power availability is a **critical constraint**, not just infrastructure count
- Hyperscaler concentration increases both opportunity and risk
- Growth momentum matters more than absolute size for expansion strategy
- Sustainability readiness varies significantly by region

---

## 📌 Why These Insights Matter
These analyses help stakeholders:
- Prioritize expansion markets
- Avoid overbuilt regions
- Plan power and sustainability strategy
- Align capital investments with long-term growth trends
